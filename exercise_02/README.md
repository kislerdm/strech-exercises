# ML Feature Table Computation

## Problem

As a data scientist, I want timeseries data with the total number of transactions a user made in the last 7 days from a
given date.

The timeseries should have the following dimensions:
- transaction_id
- user_id

## Proposed Solution

Prepare a SQL query to calculate required KPI using the data from the `transactions` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions
(
    transaction_id          UUID,
    date                    DATE,
    user_id                 UUID,
    is_blocked              BOOL,
    transaction_amount      INTEGER,
    transaction_category_id INTEGER
);
```

The desired table would look as following.

| transaction_id |  user_id  |    date    | # Transaction within previous 7 days |
|:--------------:|:---------:|:----------:|-------------------------------------:|
|   ef05-4247    | becf-457e | 2020-01-01 |                                    0 |
|   c8d1-40ca    | becf-457e | 2020-01-05 |                                    1 |
|   fc2b-4b36    | becf-457e | 2020-01-07 |                                    2 |
|   3725-48c4    | becf-457e | 2020-01-15 |                                    0 |        
|   5f2a-47c2    | becf-457e | 2020-01-16 |                                    1 |        
|   7541-412c    | 5728-4f1c | 2020-01-01 |                                    0 |        
|   3deb-47d7    | 5728-4f1c | 2020-01-12 |                                    0 |

## Acceptance Criteria

- Postgres compatible [ANSI compliant](https://www.oninit.com/manual/informix/100/ddi/ddi32.htm) SQL query is designed.
- Steps of the query planner are described to explain what a database engine considers for effectively query execution.

## Solution

Please find the solution in the [solution.sql](solution.sql).

### Tests

_Requirements_:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) ~> 20.10
- [gnuMake](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

**Note**: the docker compose v2 is used, i.e. `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose` command.

Run tests by executing the command:

```commandline
make tests
```

Expected output:

```commandline
Run tests
INFO:  TEST: optimised query results must match the reference. <PASS>
 test 
------
 
(1 row)
```
